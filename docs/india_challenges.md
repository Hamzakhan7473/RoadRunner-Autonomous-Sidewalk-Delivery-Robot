### Impact on Robot Operations
- Collision risks with unpredictable actors
- Navigation delays due to congestion
- Difficulty in maintaining safe distances
- Cultural misunderstandings in navigation

### Proposed Solutions

#### 1. Perception Tuning for India
```python
Detection Categories:
  - Humans (pedestrians, vendors, customers)
  - Animals (dogs, cows, goats, birds)
  - Vehicles (cycles, autorickshaws, carts, motorcycles)
  - Infrastructure (street vendors, temporary structures)
  - Obstacles (debris, construction materials)
```

#### 2. Social Navigation Behaviors
- **Speed Adaptation**: Slower speeds in crowded areas (0.5-1.0 m/s)
- **Yield Protocols**: Always yield to humans and animals
- **Voice Prompts**: Polite announcements in local languages
- **Body Language**: Clear movement intentions through LED indicators

#### 3. Geo-fencing Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Controlled environments (campuses, gated communities)
- **Phase 2**: IT parks and industrial areas
- **Phase 3**: Residential colonies with RWA support
- **Phase 4**: Commercial areas with municipal cooperation

## 🌧️ Challenge 3: Weather Extremes

### Problem Description
- **Monsoon Season**: Heavy rains, waterlogging, and flooding
- **Summer Heat**: Dust storms, high temperatures (40-45°C)
- **Visibility Issues**: Reduced sensor performance in adverse weather
- **Surface Changes**: Wet, slippery, or muddy conditions

### Impact on Robot Operations
- Sensor degradation in poor weather
- Increased slip and fall risks
- Reduced battery life in extreme temperatures
