# 🇮🇳 India-Ready Delivery Robot

A comprehensive research project for developing autonomous delivery robots specifically designed for Indian urban environments.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project addresses the unique challenges of deploying autonomous delivery robots in Indian cities, including uneven sidewalks, high pedestrian density, stray animals, weather extremes, and cultural navigation patterns.

## 🚧 Key Challenges Addressed

1. **Infrastructure Challenges**: Uneven sidewalks, missing pathways, potholes
2. **Traffic Complexity**: High density of people, animals, vehicles, and unpredictable actors
3. **Weather Extremes**: Monsoons, dust storms, heat waves
4. **Security Concerns**: Theft, vandalism, and misuse prevention
5. **Cultural Navigation**: Understanding Indian traffic patterns and social etiquette
